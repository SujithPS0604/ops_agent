## Security Considerations

OPS Agent prioritizes security through a comprehensive approach:

1. **Local-Only Processing**: All AI processing occurs on-premises using Ollama
2. **No External APIs**: Zero communication with external services
3. **Containerized Isolation**: Each component runs in isolated Docker containers
4. **Role-Based Access**: Configurable permissions for different operational roles
5. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all operations and queries
6. **Data Minimization**: Only necessary operational data is processed

## Deployment Architecture

The solution is packaged as a set of Docker containers orchestrated through Docker Compose. This approach ensures:

1. **Portability**: Runs consistently across development, testing, and production environments
2. **Isolation**: Components operate independently with defined interfaces
3. **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled based on demand
4. **Easy Updates**: Components can be updated independently

   - AI-assisted test coverage optimization

3. **Deployment Phase**:
   - Pre-deployment risk assessment
   - Intelligent canary analysis

4. **Operations Phase**:
   - Real-time anomaly detection
   - Automated incident response suggestions
   - Self-improving troubleshooting based on resolution patterns

## Workflow Integration

OPS Agent integrates seamlessly with existing operational workflows:

1. **Incident Management**:
   - Direct integration with ticketing systems
   - Automated collection of relevant diagnostic information

2. **On-Call Rotation**:

## Using OPS Agent

### Basic Usage

1. **Start the Environment**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

2. **Initialize Required Resources**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it ops_agent-localstack-1 bash /docker-entrypoint-initaws.d/01-init-queues.sh
   ```

3. **Access the UI** at http://localhost:3000

4. **Enter Operational Queries** such as:
   - "Show all errors in the order service from the last hour"
   - "Check the status of the order-queue and summarize DLQ contents"
   - "Analyze the root cause of transaction failures"

### Advanced Scenarios

1. **Cross-Service Correlation**:
   ```
   Investigate why order #12345 failed and identify all related log entries across services
   ```

2. **Pattern Analysis**:
   ```
   Find repeating error patterns in the payment service over the last 24 hours
   ```

3. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   ```
   What's causing the increased latency in the checkout flow?
   ```
